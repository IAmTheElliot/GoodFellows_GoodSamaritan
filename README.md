The Good Samaritan "goodSam" Web Application

Good Samaritan is an application that puts users in contact with each other to resolve issues or problems that they are experiencing. The requestor submits an issue to the database, which is populated in the request feed of the application for other users. Another user who wishes to help may respond by selecting the issue from their feed. Once clicked, the application will return the contact information of the requestor, and the responder can contact the requestor via email or phone. Once the issue has been successfully resolved, the requestor may then deactivate the request from their user feed. All request feeds are automatically updated when a new request is submitted or an active request is deactivated.
